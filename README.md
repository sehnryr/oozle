# oozle

A Rust library for decompressing Kraken, Mermaid, Selkie, Leviathan, LZNA 
and Bitknit compressed buffers. (unsafe)

This library implements [powzix's ooz](https://github.com/powzix/ooz) and uses
[CXX](https://cxx.rs/) to interop with Rust. In the future, (I hope) this 
library will be fully implemented in Rust.
